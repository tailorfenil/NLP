NLP-1 (TF-IDF / Word2Vec )

Identifying suitable reviewers for research conferences and journals poses challenges in the face of interdisciplinary research and the ever-changing profiles of researchers. Conventionally, the selection of reviewers relies on the contact network of technical chairs. However, finding reviewers with precise expertise has become increasingly complex with the growing interdisciplinarity of research and the dynamic nature of researchers' profiles. The goal is to address this challenge by leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to facilitate reviewer selection. By harnessing NLP techniques, we aim to match reviewers from a pool of candidates whose expertise closely aligns with the content of the invited papers.
